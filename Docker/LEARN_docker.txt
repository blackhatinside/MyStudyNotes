an Image is like a template that can spawn multiple containers (running instances of that image). Containers can be started, stopped, restarted, paused, unpaused, and removed.


// to install an image
docker pull image_name

// to see all the installed images
docker images

// to run an image
docker run image_name

// to run an image in detached mode
docker run -d image_name

// to see all the running containers
docker ps

// to see all the running and stopped containers
docker ps -a

// to start a container
docker start container_name

// to stop a container
docker stop container_name

// to check the logs of the container
docker logs container_name
