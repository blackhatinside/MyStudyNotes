Perfect — your setup sounds pretty solid already! Here's how everything fits together:

---

### Your current setup:

* **Windows 11** — likely installed in UEFI mode, with its own EFI System Partition (ESP).
* **Linux Mint** — installed alongside Windows, probably sharing the same ESP for bootloader files.
* Mint has its own root and swap partitions.
* You want to add **LFS** on a *completely separate* 50GB partition on the same SSD.

---

### How this works with UEFI and multiple Linux systems:

* **One EFI System Partition (ESP)** is shared by all OSes on the disk (Windows, Mint, and soon LFS).
* This ESP stores EFI bootloaders (like GRUB’s `.efi` files).
* When you install GRUB for LFS, you **mount the existing ESP** at `/boot/efi` in LFS and install the LFS bootloader files there.
* The UEFI firmware will then see multiple boot entries: Windows Boot Manager, Mint’s GRUB, and soon LFS’s GRUB (or LFS added to existing GRUB menu).

---

### So **you don’t need another ESP partition** for LFS.

**Just:**

* Mount the existing ESP (probably the same one Mint uses) at `/boot/efi` when you chroot into LFS.
* Install GRUB in UEFI mode targeting that ESP.
* Update your GRUB menu to include LFS (either via Mint’s GRUB or LFS’s GRUB).

---

### Summary for your LFS partition:

* 50GB partition is great for LFS root.
* No need to create a new ESP; use the existing one.
* Mount the ESP at `/boot/efi` in LFS.
* Install GRUB in UEFI mode to the existing ESP.
* Update boot entries so UEFI can boot LFS.

---

### One extra tip:

* When you finish LFS installation and reboot, your firmware’s boot menu (`F12` or similar during boot) should show entries for Windows, Mint, and LFS.
* You can also manage boot order from BIOS/UEFI or via GRUB’s menu.

If you want, I can help you with the exact commands to mount the ESP and install GRUB inside your LFS environment. Would you like that?
