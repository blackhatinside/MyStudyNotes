Absolutely! If you're looking to strip down **Linux Mint XFCE** for a **persistent USB setup**, you can remove unnecessary applications and services to reduce its footprint while maintaining persistence across reboots. Here’s a step-by-step guide to making Linux Mint XFCE lighter, all while keeping it user-friendly for your LFS project or general use.

### 1. **Create a Persistent USB Setup**

Before we strip things down, ensure you have **persistence** set up. This ensures any changes you make to the system (like removing packages or editing settings) will persist across reboots.

#### How to Create a Persistent Linux Mint USB:

* Use a tool like **Rufus**, **Ventoy**, or **UNetbootin** to create a bootable USB.
* During the process, allocate some space for persistence. For example, in Rufus, you can enable persistence in the options before creating the bootable USB. Choose how much space you want to allocate for persistence (typically around 4-8 GB).
* Make sure you select the "persistence" option if you're using **Ventoy** or **UNetbootin**.

Once you’ve set up the USB stick with persistence, boot into Linux Mint XFCE from the USB.

### 2. **Removing Unnecessary Software and Services**

Linux Mint XFCE comes with a variety of pre-installed software. If you’re aiming for a lightweight setup, you’ll want to remove unnecessary applications and services. Here’s a breakdown of what to remove:

#### a. **Remove Unnecessary Applications**

You can remove software that’s not essential to your needs. Some apps that are often safe to remove for a lighter system:

* **LibreOffice** (If you don’t need an office suite)
* **Firefox** (You can switch to a lighter browser like **Midori**, **Qutebrowser**, or **Brave**)
* **Thunderbird** (If you don’t need an email client)
* **MintWelcome** (The Mint welcome screen can be skipped)
* **MintUpdate** (If you want more control over updates via terminal)

To remove these:

```bash
sudo apt remove --purge libreoffice* firefox thunderbird mintwelcome mintupdate
sudo apt autoremove --purge
```

#### b. **Remove Unneeded System Services**

Disable services that aren’t required for your use case. For example, if you don’t need Bluetooth, printing, or any heavy desktop services, you can disable them.

To disable Bluetooth:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth
sudo systemctl stop bluetooth
```

To disable printing services:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable cups
sudo systemctl stop cups
```

If you use `systemd`, you can check which services are running by:

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service
```

#### c. **Remove Unnecessary Startup Applications**

Some applications might start automatically, even though you don’t need them. You can disable unnecessary startup applications:

1. Open the **Startup Applications** tool (Menu → **Startup Applications**).
2. Go through the list and disable any applications you don't need starting up every time.

Or manually by editing `~/.config/autostart/` and removing unwanted `.desktop` files.

#### d. **Remove Unnecessary XFCE Components**

XFCE is lightweight, but some components might still be overkill if you need a minimal environment. If you don’t need the panel, compositing, or any XFCE-specific utilities, consider removing them.

For example:

```bash
sudo apt remove --purge xfce4-settings xfce4-power-manager xfce4-panel xfwm4
```

This will remove the panel and window manager, but **be careful** since this will make your system more difficult to navigate without the desktop environment components.

### 3. **Optimize the System for Performance**

#### a. **Optimize Swappiness (if using swap)**

If you have a swap partition or swap file on your USB, you can adjust the **swappiness** setting to control how aggressively Linux will use swap space.

To change swappiness:

```bash
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
```

You can also make this permanent by adding it to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```bash
echo "vm.swappiness=10" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```

#### b. **Remove or Optimize Logs**

Persistent setups often accumulate logs over time. To avoid filling up your persistent space, you can clean up logs.

You can configure **logrotate** to keep logs minimal or use the following to clear logs:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/log/*
```

### 4. **Reduce Disk Space Usage**

#### a. **Remove Thumbnails Cache**

Over time, Linux stores thumbnails for images and videos. You can clean up the thumbnails cache to save space:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cache/thumbnails/*
```

#### b. **Remove Cached Package Files**

Package files from `apt` can accumulate over time. You can clear them with:

```bash
sudo apt clean
```

### 5. **Optional: Use a Lighter Window Manager**

If XFCE is still too heavy for your taste, consider switching to a **lighter window manager** like **Openbox** or **i3**.

To install **Openbox**:

```bash
sudo apt install openbox
```

To switch to **Openbox** after installation, logout, and select **Openbox** from the login manager. You may also need to configure **Openbox** to start some essential system processes.

### 6. **Make Changes Persistent**

Since you're working with a **persistent USB** setup, any modifications you make (like removing software or changing system settings) will be saved automatically. However, be cautious with changes that might affect the boot process or essential utilities—backup your USB stick before making drastic changes!

### Conclusion

Stripping down **Linux Mint XFCE** for a persistent USB setup involves:

* **Removing unnecessary software** like office suites, browsers, and email clients.
* **Disabling unneeded services** such as Bluetooth and printing.
* **Optimizing system performance** by tweaking things like swappiness and cleaning up log files.
* **Optional: Switching to a lighter window manager** if XFCE still feels heavy.

This approach will significantly reduce the resource footprint and make the system lighter while maintaining the **persistence** for your changes.
