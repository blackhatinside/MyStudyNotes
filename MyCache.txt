make tables for { driver rider cab trip location }
create relationship between 2 tables

Conditions:
	drivers >= cabs
	boolean addDriver if 1 then insert, if 0 then delete
	boolean acceptTrip if 1 then insert, if 0 then delete
	boolean autoApproval if 1 then addDriver = 1, if 0 then addDriver = 0
Graph  - Locations/NodePoints:
	weights = distance
	cost = weight * base_rate
	Keys: Array of elements
	Values: Linked List
	triangular inequality: d(v) < d(u) + w(u,v)
		You add a new edge (u,v), you need to check if the triangular inequality holds:
		d(v) < d(u) + w(u,v)
		If it does, there is no new shortest path.
		Otherwise, you have a new shortest path from the source (A) to v, which invalidates all shortest paths with weight greater than the new d(v).

Design a Call taxi booking application

-There are n number of taxi’s. For simplicity, assume 4. But it should work for any number of taxi’s.

-The are 6 points(A,B,C,D,E,F)

-All the points are in a straight line, and each point is 15kms away from the adjacent points.

-It takes 60 mins to travel from one point to another

-Each taxi charges Rs.100 minimum for the first 5 kilometers and Rs.10 for the subsequent kilometers.

-For simplicity, time can be entered as absolute time. Eg: 9hrs, 15hrs etc.

-All taxi’s are initially stationed at A.

-When a customer books a Taxi, a free taxi at that point is allocated

-If no free taxi is available at that point, a free taxi at the nearest point is allocated.

-If two taxi’s are free at the same point, one with lower earning is allocated

-Note that the taxi only charges the customer from the pickup point to the drop point. Not the distance it travels from an adjacent point to pickup the customer.

-If no taxi is free at that time, booking is rejected

Below is an aggregated evaluation of the three offers, taking into account factors such as CTC, growth, job stability, ease of switching, promotions, perks, work–life balance, and the difficulty of the job. (Note that the scores and rankings are based on qualitative assessments and may vary according to personal priorities.)

Estimated Ratings (Out of 5)
Factor	HCL Software (Full‑Stack SSE)	Convin.ai (Backend Developer)	C‑DOT (Scientist B)
CTC	5 (20 LPA – top-tier corporate)	5 (20 LPA – competitive startup)	5 (20 LPA – premium for role)
Growth	3 (Structured, moderate pace)	4.5 (Fast‑paced, high potential)	2 (Steady but slow)
Job Stability	4 (High – MNC backed)	3 (Moderate – inherent startup risk)	5 (Very high – public sector)
Switch/Mobility	4 (Strong brand aids switching)	3 (Somewhat flexible, but riskier externally)	2 (Low mobility)
Promotions	3 (Standard, gradual)	4 (Potentially rapid if growth succeeds)	2 (Slow, bureaucratic)
Perks	3.5 (Good corporate benefits)	4 (Attractive perks like course reimbursements, travel allowance)	3.5 (Solid public sector benefits)
Work–Life Balance	3.5 (Moderate to good)	2.5 (Often demanding, startup culture)	5 (Excellent balance)
Difficulty of Job	3 (Moderate – enterprise-scale challenges)	2 (High – fast-paced, high pressure)	3 (Moderate – research‑oriented)
(Each factor is scored out of 5; a higher score is better.)




























@/src/  I need a complete implementation of a Multi User (Pub-Sub type) collaborative diagrammatic environment using CRDT (use Array of Maps Shared Type in Yjs (use p_py for python bindings)). There are going to be nodes (JSON) and edges (JSON), and its going to be a 2D plane, nodes can be placed (using [x,y] coordinates stored as a field in the JSON). Node data (JSON) has configurations which can be edited. Multiple peers can edit the same node at the same time (distributed environment). There can be edges (JSON) too across any 2 nodes. Edges are used for connecting nodes. Even Edges can be updated to point to different nodes. Nodes denote parameters, and edges denote boolean operators (either OR or AND). Make a prototype for now to check for Eventual Consistency. I should be able to simulate different pubs subscribing to the same URL and be able to edit the configuration of the json_objects/blocks/parameters and also the configuration of the edges. Also make sure there's no orthogonal conflict (2D plane conflict when multiple people try to drag and replace position of same block at the same time). Also note that I have already run "pip install ypy-websocket" and  "pip install y-py" in the python virtual environment venv which I have setup in this project, so you don't have to install those libraries again for this task. You can use the src folder for this project, create any files you want for the project, edit existing files. Make sure the code doesn't break when it's run. I am also sharing a sample collaborative diagram's code below for your understanding and reference:
