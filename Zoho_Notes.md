To fully understand the two files you’ve shared and the processes involved, you’ll need a solid foundation in several **technology stacks**, **software concepts**, and **computer science (CS) principles**. These concepts cover everything from basic build processes and version control to more advanced topics like deployment, database management, and Java web application development.

Here’s a breakdown of the key areas to focus on:

### **1. Build Tools and Automation**

* **Build Automation**: Learn about build tools and automation processes, such as **Ant**, **Maven**, or **Gradle**.

  * **Ant**: The file mentions `ant build` and using `pmp_head.xml`, which is an XML-based configuration for Ant builds. Understanding Ant’s **XML-based build script** structure is essential to understand how your application is being compiled and packaged.
  * **CI/CD**: Familiarize yourself with **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** practices, as they often involve similar automated build and deployment processes.
  * **Batch Scripts (`.bat`)**: Understand Windows batch scripting (`.bat`), which is often used to automate system tasks (e.g., `importCert.bat`, `startDB.bat`).

### **2. Java Development**

* **Java Programming**: The instructions involve Java concepts, particularly for building JAR files and running Java commands. Brush up on the following:

  * **JAR files**: Learn about **Java ARchives** (JAR files) and how they bundle Java classes, libraries, and resources into a single file.
  * **Compiling Java Code**: Learn about compiling Java code and using tools like **javac** for compiling `.java` files into bytecode (`.class`).
  * **Java Development Tools (JDK)**: The steps involve configuring the **JDK** (Java Development Kit), especially the `tools.jar` file. You’ll need to understand what’s included in the JDK and how it interacts with Java programs.
  * **Java Packaging & Deployment**: Understand how Java applications are packaged and deployed, including understanding JAR files, WAR files (for web applications), and libraries.

### **3. Version Control**

* **Mercurial (or Git)**: Learn about **Mercurial** (mentioned as the version control system used) or **Git** (if you're more familiar with it). You should know how to **clone repositories**, manage branches, and track changes.

  * Focus on the **command-line interface (CLI)** for version control systems, as it’s frequently used in deployment processes.
  * Learn about **commit history** and how to check out specific versions or revisions of code.

### **4. Web Application Development (Java Web)**

* **Java EE / Servlet-based Applications**: The instructions mention **webapps**, so understanding **Java web development** is crucial.

  * Learn about **Servlets** and **JSPs** (JavaServer Pages) as the likely technologies behind the web interface of your application.
  * **Web.xml**: This is a configuration file used to set up web application settings (servlet configurations, security constraints, etc.). Understanding `web.xml` configuration is essential for managing the deployment of Java-based web applications.

### **5. Databases**

* **PostgreSQL**:

  * Understand **PostgreSQL** or any relational database, as you’re dealing with configuration files (`postgres_ext.conf`) and database operations (`startDB.bat`).
  * Learn about **database extensions** and how they can be configured in PostgreSQL. `postgres_ext.conf` likely involves custom PostgreSQL extensions.
  * Understand basic **SQL operations** and how Java interacts with databases (e.g., through JDBC).
* **Data Dictionaries**:

  * The build process involves modifying a `data-dictionary.xml` file. This is likely a **metadata description** for a database schema, so understanding **data dictionaries** in the context of database design and management is helpful.

### **6. Server Configuration & Deployment**

* **Web Server/Servlet Containers**:

  * The use of **wrapper.exe** suggests some sort of server or service wrapper, which might be used for managing Java-based services. Learn about **application servers** (like **Apache Tomcat**, **Jetty**, or **WildFly**) and how Java applications are deployed and run on them.
* **SSL/TLS & Certificates**:

  * **importCert.bat** deals with importing server certificates (`serverCer.cer`). You should understand **SSL/TLS** certificates, **public-key infrastructure (PKI)**, and how they’re used in securing web applications.

### **7. Scripting & Shell Commands**

* **Batch Scripts (`.bat`)**:

  * Batch scripts are commonly used for automating tasks on Windows systems. Learn the basics of writing batch scripts (e.g., `importCert.bat`, `startDB.bat`, and `copy.bat`).
  * Understand basic commands for file manipulation, setting environment variables, and executing programs.

* **Shell Scripting (`copy.sh`)**:

  * Shell scripting in Linux/Unix systems (like `copy.sh`) is another important skill. Learn how to write and execute basic shell scripts, especially those dealing with file copying, running commands, and modifying files.

### **8. JavaScript, Frontend Development, and Ember.js**

* **Ember.js**:

  * Some steps involve replacing JavaScript files for **Ember components**. If you're unfamiliar with **Ember.js**, you should study the **Ember framework** and understand how it handles client-side rendering and JavaScript logic for web applications.
  * Learn about the role of JavaScript in **frontend development**, particularly in the context of web applications that rely heavily on client-side scripting.

* **Web Frontend Technologies**:

  * **HTML/CSS**: Basics of web page structure and styling.
  * **JavaScript**: Learn about the role of JavaScript in modern web applications (e.g., in handling DOM manipulation, AJAX requests, and client-side routing).

### **9. Networking & Servers**

* **Networking**: Learn the basics of **network communication** (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, ports) since the steps involve configuring and starting services (e.g., `startDB.bat`, `pmp.bat`).

### **10. Security Concepts**

* **Security and Certificates**:

  * Learn about **digital certificates**, **SSL/TLS**, and **certificate authorities (CAs)** as they’re used to establish trust in server-client communication (e.g., in `importCert.bat`).
* **Access Control and Security Checks**:

  * The mention of `skipsecuritycheck.fjar` and replacing JavaScript components indicates some aspects of **security control** in your application. You may need to understand **security check mechanisms**, such as login procedures, role-based access, and how to configure them in Java-based web applications.

### **11. Debugging & Troubleshooting**

* **Log Management**: Understanding how to read and interpret logs (e.g., logs generated by the `wrapper.exe` or server logs) will be useful for debugging deployment or runtime issues.
* **Error Handling**: Learn how to handle exceptions and errors during build, deployment, or execution, especially in Java web applications.
